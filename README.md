# Arch

Simple Bash script I'm working on that will install Arch Linux for you along with a desired Desktop Environment, as well as some programs. This script can be used after loading into the Arch Linux live environment.

## How to use

First, boot into the Arch Linux live environment from the [Arch Linux image](https://www.archlinux.org/download/).
Then make sure you have Internet connection as this will be necessary for the downloading of the programs.
You can then download and run script running the following command:
`bash <(curl -sL bit.ly/31zj9mi)`
There will be some prompts during the script's runtime to customize the install to your liking.

After the install is done, you can now reboot into your new Arch Linux installation!
